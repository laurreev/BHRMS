Name: Barangay Health Referral Management System

Objectives of this Project

	To develop a Barangay Health Referral Management System (BHRMS) that digitalizes and streamlines the referral process between barangay health centers and partner healthcare facilities.

Specific Objectives:
Create a user-friendly system for encoding, generating, and storing referral records.
Allow authorized health workers to track referral status and patient history.
Reduce manual paperwork and long processing times.
Generate standardized digital referral forms.
Improve coordination between facilities through secure digital validation.

Features for (Workers)
The development plan for the Barangay Health Referral Management System (BHRMS) will prioritize speed and accountability, beginning with a streamlined Staff ID Login. Health workers will access the app using their unique credential number, confirming their identity through a quick name prompt ("Is this you?")—a password-less process that ensures both rapid access and personal accountability. The system’s core resources, available to all staff, will include a Geographic Referral Map that allows users to quickly locate and view contact and service capacity details for all Barangay Health Stations (BHS) and receiving hospitals. This is complemented by a Health Hotlines page for immediate access to ambulance and critical care contacts, and a Health Protocols & Guides page offering essential, updated resources (like triage flowcharts and care infographics) to aid decision-making at the BHS level.

For Municipal Health Office (MHO) administrators, the application includes powerful, centralized management and oversight tools. An Admin User and Facility Management section enables MHO staff to efficiently add, update, and manage the accounts of BHS personnel and update the service details of receiving facilities. Crucially, the Real-Time Referral Triage Dashboard replaces the concept of a manual roll call; it serves as a live command center for tracking the status of every active referral (Pending, Accepted, Completed) across the entire health network, ensuring rapid coordination and eliminating information lag for critical patient cases. All primary navigation is handled by a responsive bottom navigation bar, with account settings and the Logout function available in a consolidated top-right menu.
